	   <h1>Understanding Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    
    <p>
        Time complexity is a measure of how the runtime of an algorithm increases with input size. An efficient algorithm has lower time complexity, meaning it executes faster as input grows.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the input size. It includes both fixed and variable memory requirements. For example, an algorithm with Space Complexity of O(n) grows linearly with input size.
